i am using audio09i2.exe  and finalrecorder06fps60nvenc.cpp       probably    - 
ctrl-c to exit 




60 fps    medium  make s a avi then tries to convert to mp4 cfr
but the avi is good enough  - probably good enough to work with as is 

it is really good 
set res in the code  and fps and other stuff

--------
//-beta09 is the newer working version - need ffmpeg in path
//audio09i   is a audio recorder --- 
//________________    both work good 
//..





sigh


activate4d with "u"  key   differetn vewrsions do diffeenet stuuf 
a   is the audio recorder
adding the newer tweak

adding   beta105-opt00mp430eFINAL.cpp
which is --- nvidia 2000+ encoder mp4 30 fps and i added in the delay buffer ( might have syntax erors due to diff ffmpeg versions )

game fps = 115         |||||||     game + screeen recorder +   asudio recortder   +   111 fps

i wroth this because  OBS saucksa  

this gets compiled with ffmpeg - whatever version works - they all work- it is just the options change, minor code depreciation and stuff like that
